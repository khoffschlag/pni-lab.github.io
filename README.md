# Website of the Predictive Neuroscience Lab

This website is based on [myst markdown](https://mystmd.org/).

## How to update contents

#### Option 1. Small fixes
- simply browse the markdown file corresponding to the page you want to edit
- edit it on github
- commit to a new branch
- make a pull request

#### Option 2. For more complex cases
- clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone [https://github.com/pni-lab/new_website.git](https://github.com/pni-lab/pni-lab.github.io.git)https://github.com/pni-lab/pni-lab.github.io.git
  cd pni-lab.github.io
  ```
- start myst
  ```bash
  myst start
  ```
  Click on the address. This starts a local webserver and renders the page in your browser. 

- edit the md files you want. You changes will be instantly visible.
- If you are ready, push your changes to a new branch and make a pull request.
