AI and ML offer more than just accelerating, automating and facilitating existing medical approaches and clinical workflows. They promise to unlock novel, and perhaps unforeseen, opportunities in medicine, addressing problems previously deemed invincible due to their immense complexities. In the field of neuroscience, these complex problems are exactly the ones that often hindered the successful integration of discoveries into translational and clinical applications. The Predictive Neuroscienvce Lab (University Hospital Essen, Germany) is a multidisciplinary team of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, engineers, computer scientists that aims to develop and apply AI and ML methods to address these complex problems. We develop "neuromarkers" of behavioral and clinical states and traits, to aid the diagnosis, stratification, prognosis and personalized intervention approaches in various neurological or psychiatric disorders and uncover the mechanisms that drive the predicted behavioral or clinical outcome.
